    <div id="intro">
      <p>
            The Cat Ark is a voluntary cat rescue in Galway, Ireland.
            We began looking after and rehoming local cats without homes
            in 2018. Since then we have helped many cats to find their happy-ever-afters.
      </p>
      
      <p>
            We also humanely trap wild cats so our vet can vaccinate and neuter or spay them. 
            When they have recovered they are then returned to their area.
            Cats and kittens that are more socialised are taken in to be rehomed. 
            Neutering cats is good for their health and prevents overpopulation. 
            Mating behaviors cease, like roaming, yowling, spraying, and fighting.
                  
      </p>

      <p>
        Adopting a cat from The Cat Ark will give them a chance at a loving home, while also making it possible 
        for us to help another cat by freeing up a space at our resce shelter. We will do our best to help match you with the right cat for you 
        and we will be here to support you whenever you need us. All of our cats have been vet checked, vaccinated and neutered or spayed, 
        ensuring your new companion is in its best health. We also microchip all of our cats which gives you a great chance 
        of being reunited should your cat ever wander.
        We do have an adoption fee of â‚¬65 which goes towards all of the vet fees this incurs.

      <p>
        Volunteers are a vital part of The Cat Ark. Without them our doors would have to close, 
        leaving so many cats to go hungry, cold and without a family to call their own. If you are interested in getting involved click the link below.
        We also need foster families to help socialise our cats and help them adjust to family life until they are ready for their forever homes.
        If you prefer to help by fundraising, arranging donations or otherwise we would be very happy to hear from you.
