                  <dt>Description:  </dt>  
                  <dd>Milo is a sweet grey tabby with black stripes. He is about a year old and is fully house-trained.
                      Milo loves head scrathes and playing with cat toys. He has lived in a foster home with children and other cats and is very well socialised.
                      He is not fond of dogs so would do better in a home without dogs. 
                      If you think Milo would be a good match for your home, we would love to hear from you!

                <dd>Nola loves to sit on your lap to nap and be petted. She is very affectionate with people but gets intimadated by
                    other cats so would be better as an only cat. She is very patient with children and is fully-housetrained.

              <dt>Description:  </dt>   
              <dd>Bella is a sweetheart and loves nothing more than a cuddle and some love. She is a bit timid around too much 
                  noise so would suit a quieter home but she is happy in the company of other cats. She is fully-housetrained.
