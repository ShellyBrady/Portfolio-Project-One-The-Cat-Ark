# Portfolio-Project-One-The-Cat-Ark
 Website for a fictional Cat Rescue and Adoption Shelter

## The Cat Ark Website
###### About

The Cat Ark Website is a site that aims to bring awareness to a cat shelter in Galway, Ireland in order to garner donations, both in funding and in supplies. 
It also shows the cats that are available to be adopted so people can be tempted into giving the cats in the shelter a new home. 
As The Cat Ark is a not-for-profit shelter, it is important to fundraise to pay for vetinary bills, supplies, food and overheads. It is therefore essential that people know that the shelter exists, all the good work it does and how important it is for the local cat population. Without an informative, eye-catching website, it will be difficult to encourage enough people to support the shelter with donations.
The site will also look for volunteers to help in the day-to-day running of the shelter.
The Cat Ark website will help people find a cat that they know is healthy, vaccinated and socialised with other cats.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator
CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
